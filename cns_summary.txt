Susan Hengeveld, a veteran biologist and saw‑whet owl specialist in Indiana’s Yellowwood State Forest, spends each fall rescuing, banding, and releasing the tiny Northern Saw‑Whet Owls that migrate through the woods. She untangles each bird from fine netting, fits a metal band, records measurements, and then passes the owl to a newcomer—often a student or volunteer—so they can feel the intimate, “silky‑warm” connection of holding a live bird. Her decades‑long effort, begun when she inherited Indiana’s first band‑ing station in 2010, feeds a long‑term dataset that has revealed the owls’ far‑reaching, multidirectional migrations, overturning the old belief that the species was rare and largely sedentary.

Before turning to owls, Susan earned a Ph.D. studying frog vocalizations, then shifted to bird song, eventually becoming a professor and director of undergraduate biology at Indiana University. Her fascination with how birds learn to sing led her to the secretive saw‑whet, whose silent, nocturnal habits made it difficult to study. By deploying ultra‑fine nets, audio lures, and meticulous record‑keeping, she and her husband Jim have built a continuous record that shows the owls traveling much farther than expected, providing vital insight into their ecology and informing conservation strategies.

A typical banding night illustrates the blend of science, skill, and patience that defines her work. Hushed by darkness and the faint calls of the owls—often only audible through hearing aids—the crew checks nets every 45 minutes, sometimes finding only spiders. When a lone owl is finally caught, a first‑time bander such as student Grace gently takes the bird, lets it settle on her arm, and then releases it into the night, its tiny wings disappearing into the black forest. These moments of hands‑on mentorship and quiet observation keep the dataset alive and ensure that, even as Susan approaches retirement, the tradition of “holding a bird in your hands” will pass to the next generation.
