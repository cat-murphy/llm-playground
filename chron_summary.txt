Quinnipiac University’s endowment has been quietly funneling tens of millions of dollars into offshore hedge funds based in the Cayman Islands. Public tax records and the university’s most recent audit show that, as of June 2023, Quinnipiac held $48.4 million in such investments, with $16.7 million tied to Monarch Debt Recovery Fund Ltd. and $23.7 million in the Pointer Offshore II fund. Although the university claims it does not directly invest in fossil fuels, Monarch’s portfolio includes sizable stakes in coal miner Arch Resources, tobacco distributor Pyxus International, and former oil‑and‑gas holdings, meaning Quinnipiac profits indirectly from these industries.

The disclosure arose from a technicality in the nonprofit Form 990 filing: institutions must detail private securities when they exceed 5 % of total assets. Quinnipiac’s private investments hit 5.2 % of its assets in FY 2018‑19, forcing the university to reveal $39.8 million in three Cayman‑based hedge funds. Subsequent audits suggest the university has maintained offshore holdings since at least FY 2015‑16, contradicting earlier filings that claimed no foreign investments above $100,000. The inconsistency raises doubts about the accuracy of past disclosures.

Quinnipiac’s offshore strategy mirrors a broader trend among Connecticut private colleges, which collectively reported $288.1 million in hedge‑fund assets in FY 2021‑22. While the university argues that participation in commingled funds offers diversification and growth for its endowment, critics note that the lack of transparency—especially with opaque funds like Pointer Offshore II and Ironwood International—makes it difficult to assess the true exposure to fossil‑fuel and tobacco interests, undermining the school’s publicly stated commitment to long‑term planetary sustainability.
